My name is Logan Stranak. I am a senior at Madison Academic High School and have played baseball for Madison for 4 years now. My favorite classes in school are history and science. I plan on attending Jackson State for my first two years of college then transferring to UT Chattanooga. I enjoy spending time with my brother and fishing. Baseball has been my passion ever since I could remember. I enjoy getting on roller coasters when I go to theme parks. Coding this year has been a very fun experience and I was happy to learn a new important skill.
